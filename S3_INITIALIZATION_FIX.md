# S3 Client Initialization Fix - Module Loading Order Issue 🔧

## The Problem

### What You Saw:
```
=== S3 Client Initialization ===
   Access Key ID: ❌ NOT SET
   Secret Access Key: ❌ NOT SET
   Bucket Name: ❌ NOT SET
   Has Access Key: false ❌
   Has Secret Key: false ❌
   Has Bucket Name: false ❌

[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (9) from .env  ← Loaded AFTER S3 initialized!
```

### Root Cause:
The S3 client was being initialized **at module load time** (when the file is first imported), which happened **BEFORE** the `.env` file was loaded.

**Timeline:**
```
1. server.ts starts
2. server.ts imports app.ts
3. app.ts imports routes
4. routes import handlers
5. handlers import s3.ts
6. s3.ts creates S3Client ← ENV VARS NOT LOADED YET! ❌
7. s3.ts reads process.env.AWS_* ← All undefined/empty
8. THEN dotenv.config() runs ← Too late!
9. NOW env vars are available ← But S3Client already created with empty values
```

## The Solution: Lazy Initialization

### What I Changed:

Changed from **eager initialization** (at module load) to **lazy initialization** (on first use).

#### BEFORE (Broken):
```typescript
// This runs immediately when file is imported - BEFORE .env loaded
const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1',  // ❌ undefined
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || '',  // ❌ empty string
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || '',  // ❌ empty string
  },
});
```

#### AFTER (Fixed):
```typescript
// Variables to hold the client instance
let s3ClientInstance: S3Client | null = null;
let s3ConfigLogged = false;

// Function that creates client ONLY when first needed
const getS3Client = (): S3Client => {
  if (!s3ClientInstance) {
    // Validate credentials FIRST
    if (!process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || !process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) {
      throw new Error('AWS credentials not found in .env');
    }

    // NOW create client with actual values from .env ✅
    s3ClientInstance = new S3Client({
      region: process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1',  // ✅ Has value
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,  // ✅ Has value
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,  // ✅ Has value
      },
    });

    console.log('✅ S3Client initialized successfully with credentials from .env');
  }
  return s3ClientInstance;
};
```

### Usage in Functions:
```typescript
export const generatePresignedUploadUrl = async (...) => {
  const bucketName = getBucketName();  // Gets value at runtime ✅
  
  // Get S3 client (created on first use with loaded env vars)
  const client = getS3Client();  // ✅ Has credentials
  
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: bucketName,  // ✅ Has value
    Key: key,
    ContentType: fileType,
  });

  const uploadUrl = await getSignedUrl(client, command, { expiresIn: 300 });
  
  return { uploadUrl, fileUrl, key };
};
```

## How It Works Now

### New Timeline:
```
1. server.ts starts
2. server.ts calls dotenv.config() ✅ ENV VARS LOADED
3. server.ts imports app.ts
4. app.ts imports routes
5. routes import handlers
6. handlers import s3.ts
7. s3.ts defines getS3Client() function (doesn't run yet) ✅
8. Server starts and waits for requests

--- User uploads image ---

9. Handler calls generatePresignedUploadUrl()
10. generatePresignedUploadUrl() calls getS3Client()
11. getS3Client() checks if client exists (no)
12. getS3Client() reads process.env.AWS_* ← ✅ VALUES AVAILABLE!
13. getS3Client() creates S3Client with real credentials ✅
14. Returns presigned URL successfully ✅
```

## Benefits of Lazy Initialization

### ✅ Advantages:
1. **Environment variables loaded first** - Always reads correct values
2. **Explicit error handling** - Throws clear error if credentials missing
3. **Performance** - Only creates client when actually needed
4. **Debugging** - Logs configuration when first used
5. **Testability** - Easier to mock in tests

### 🎯 Key Points:
- S3Client is created **on first use**, not at import time
- By then, `.env` is definitely loaded
- Subsequent calls reuse the same instance (singleton pattern)
- Validates credentials before creating client
- Clear error messages if configuration is missing

---

## What You'll See Now

### On Server Start (No S3 logs yet):
```
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (9) from .env
Server running on port 8080
Database is connected!
```

### On First Upload Request:
```
=== S3 Client Initialization (First Use) ===
📋 Configuration Details:
   Region: us-east-1
   Access Key ID: AKIA5HME...
   Secret Access Key: ******************** (52 chars)
   Bucket Name: campus-marketplace-team15

🔍 Validation:
   Has Region: true ✅
   Has Access Key: true ✅
   Has Secret Key: true ✅
   Has Bucket Name: true ✅
================================

✅ S3Client initialized successfully with credentials from .env

📤 Generating presigned URL: {
  bucketName: 'campus-marketplace-team15',
  key: 'listings/12345-abc.jpg',
  fileType: 'image/jpeg',
  folder: 'listings'
}

✅ Generated Presigned URL for: photo.jpg
📋 Upload URL: https://campus-marketplace-team15.s3...
📋 File URL: https://campus-marketplace-team15.s3...
📋 S3 Key: listings/12345-abc.jpg
```

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Try Uploading an Image
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Login to your account
3. Go to "Create New Listing"
4. Upload an image

### Step 2: Check Server Terminal
You should see:
- ✅ S3Client initialization with all credentials present
- ✅ Presigned URL generated successfully
- ✅ All env vars loaded correctly

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
You should see:
```
📤 Starting upload for 1 files
🔄 Uploading to S3: {...}
✅ S3 upload successful: 200
✅ Upload successful
```

## Verification Checklist

After this fix, verify:

- [ ] Server starts without S3 initialization errors
- [ ] S3 client logs appear only when first upload is attempted
- [ ] All environment variables show ✅ (not ❌ NOT SET)
- [ ] Access Key ID shows actual value (not empty)
- [ ] Secret Key shows length (not 0 chars)
- [ ] Bucket Name shows actual bucket name
- [ ] Presigned URL is generated successfully
- [ ] Browser can upload to S3 (if Block Public Access is off)

## Common Module Loading Issues in Node.js

This is a common pattern for preventing module loading order issues:

### ❌ Anti-Pattern (Eager):
```typescript
// BAD: Reads env at import time
const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,  // Might be undefined
};

export function useConfig() {
  return config;  // Returns empty/undefined values
}
```

### ✅ Best Practice (Lazy):
```typescript
// GOOD: Reads env at runtime
export function getConfig() {
  return {
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY || throw new Error('API_KEY required'),
  };
}
```

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `/server/utils/s3.ts` - Implemented lazy S3Client initialization
   - Added `getS3Client()` function
   - Singleton pattern for client instance
   - Runtime validation of credentials
   - Detailed logging on first use

---

## Status

✅ **S3 Client initialization fixed**
✅ **Environment variables loaded before S3Client created**
✅ **Credentials validated before use**
✅ **Clear error messages if config missing**
✅ **Ready for uploads**

---

## Next Step

**Try uploading an image now!**

The S3 client will initialize properly with your credentials from `.env` and you should be able to generate presigned URLs successfully.

**Don't forget:** You still need to turn off "Block Public Access" in S3 for the browser to successfully upload to the presigned URL!
