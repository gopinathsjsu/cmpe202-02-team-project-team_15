## Abhishek

**1. What tasks did I work on / complete?**

- Implemented configuration updates in the backend **`package.json`** — switched to **CommonJS setup.**
- Integrated **TypeScript** support for backend, replacing **controllers with handlers** for better structure.
- Updated **frontend `package.json`** to use **Vite** instead of `react-scripts` for faster builds and better compatibilty with other team members.
- Set **TypeScript version to 5.9.2**, added **dev scripts** for `tsc` compilation, and configured **`ts-node`** in backend `package.json`.

**2. What am I planning to work on next?**

- Start working on the **Edit and View Profile** features (frontend and backend integration).

**3. What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**

- Not a blocker, but currently waiting for **merge requests** from other team members to be approved in order to finalize previous work.

## Manoj

**1. What tasks did I work on / complete?**

- Look up for merge conflicts and try to make sure the application flow works fine when everyone’s trying to push code to the main branch.

**2. What am I planning to work on next?**

- Finish my ‘backlog’ story regarding report listing.

**3. What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**

- Blocker is on me currently, before we get started with admin user stories (just to make sure when stories get assigned to team members they needn’t assume)
