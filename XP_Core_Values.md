## Two XP Values the team demonstrated throughout the project. 

### Communication

Our team emphasized strong communication by holding stand-up meetings three times a week, ensuring everyone stayed aligned on progress, blockers, and upcoming tasks. These regular check-ins helped the team coordinate effectively, quickly address obstacles, and support each other as priorities shifted throughout the project.

In addition to live discussions, we used GitHub pull requests as our structured method of sharing, reviewing, and improving code. Each PR included clear descriptions and discussions, allowing team members to collaboratively refine changes before merging. This combination of consistent stand-ups and transparent PR workflows created a communication system that kept the entire team synchronized and productive.

### Courage

The team demonstrated courage by being open to difficult conversations during pull request reviews, raising concerns respectfully, and taking ownership of improvements even when they required significant rework. Team members were willing to challenge ideas, question assumptions, and refine their own contributions to ensure the highest-quality outcome.

Beyond technical feedback, the team consistently stepped outside their comfort zones by volunteering for unfamiliar user stories and taking on responsibilities they hadn’t handled before. Rather than avoiding new territory, members embraced these opportunities as chances to learn and grow. This willingness to tackle uncertain or challenging tasks strengthened both the project and the team’s collective skill set.
