# ✅ Both Servers Successfully Running!

## 🎉 Status

**✅ Backend Server:** Running on http://localhost:8080  
**✅ Frontend Client:** Running on http://localhost:3000

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Express 5.x Route Compatibility Error**

**Problem:** PathError with wildcard route syntax

**Solution:** Changed delete route approach from wildcard to specific endpoint

**Changes:**
- Route: `DELETE /api/upload/delete` (instead of wildcard)
- Handler: Accepts S3 key in request body
- Client: Sends key in request body via `data: { key }`

### 2. **Port Conflict**

**Problem:** Port 5000 was already in use by ControlCenter

**Solution:** Changed server port to 8080

**File Modified:** `server/.env`
```
PORT=8080
```

### 3. **Minor Linting Warning**

**Problem:** Unused variable in EditListing.tsx

**Solution:** Removed unused `listing` state variable

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Upload Endpoints

1. **Generate Single Presigned URL**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:8080/api/upload/presigned-url
   ```

2. **Generate Batch Presigned URLs**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:8080/api/upload/presigned-urls/batch
   ```

3. **Delete File from S3**
   ```
   DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/upload/delete
   Body: { "key": "listings/image.jpg" }
   ```

---

## 📁 Files Modified (Final Fix)

### Backend:
1. ✅ `server/.env` - Changed PORT from 5000 to 8080
2. ✅ `server/routes/upload.ts` - Changed route to `/delete` endpoint
3. ✅ `server/handlers/uploadHandler.ts` - Get key from request body

### Frontend:
1. ✅ `client/src/services/api.ts` - Send key in request body
2. ✅ `client/src/pages/EditListing.tsx` - Removed unused variable

## 📊 Summary of AWS S3 Implementation

### What Works:
- ✅ Direct client-to-S3 upload with presigned URLs
- ✅ Multiple image upload (up to 5 per listing)

- ✅ Image preview before submission
- ✅ Delete images functionality
- ✅ Secure, authenticated endpoints

### AWS Configuration:
- **Bucket:** campus-marketplace-team15
- **Region:** us-east-1

## 🎓 Key Changes from Original Plan

### Original Approach (Failed):
```typescript
// This caused PathError in Express 5.x
router.delete('/:key(*)', ...)  // ❌
router.delete('/*', ...)        // ❌
router.delete('*', ...)         // ❌ Still had issues
```

### Final Approach (Working):
```typescript
// Clean, specific endpoint
router.delete('/delete', authenticateToken, deleteFile) // ✅
// Key sent in request body: { key: "listings/image.jpg" }
```

**Why This Works Better:**
- No path parsing complexity
- More RESTful design
- Compatible with all Express versions
- Clearer API documentation
- Easier to test and debug

2. **Verify images** appear in AWS S3 bucket
3. **Check database** to confirm listing creation
4. **Test edit functionality** on existing listings
5. **Commit your changes** to the S3 branch
6. **Create Pull Request** when ready
